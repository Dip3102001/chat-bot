Early Childhood and Personal Interests
I have always been a naturally curious individual, constantly questioning everything and striving to understand concepts at a fundamental level. This trait has set me apart and laid the foundation for my educational journey.

Beyond academics, I have a strong interest in cooking, watching movies, and discussing global developments with friends over coffee. I make it a habit to watch at least one podcast daily for about half an hour to stay updated on the latest trends and technological advancements. These insights often become great conversation starters, even during casual interactions like elevator rides with strangers.

Academic and Professional Journey
Currently, I am pursuing a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo while simultaneously working on various side projects to strengthen my skills and enhance my employability post-graduation. My daily routine revolves around coding, assignments, job applications, and self-sufficiency—cooking for myself being an essential part of it.

Personality and Experiences
I consider myself slightly introverted, which, as a lighthearted stereotype, aligns with the idea that many programmers are naturally reserved. However, I take my time to get comfortable in new and unfamiliar environments.

A notable experience that reflects this aspect of my personality is a trip to Manali, India, with my friends before moving to Canada. Initially hesitant, I eventually gave in to their insistence, and it turned out to be a remarkable adventure. We engaged in activities like camping, trekking, rock climbing, river rafting, and paragliding—experiences I wouldn’t have pursued on my own. One of the most thrilling moments was riding on top of a car while ascending the valley. This journey taught me that stepping out of my comfort zone leads to unforgettable memories and personal growth.

Over time, I have developed a passion for cooking, which I find strikingly similar to coding. Just as different programmers have unique ways of solving problems, chefs have distinct cooking styles—both ultimately achieving the same goal through different approaches. The process of sharing recipes parallels the way developers exchange coding solutions, and when executed well, both bring immense satisfaction.

Interest in Games and Competitive Nature
Since childhood, I have been passionate about games, both indoor and outdoor. I played cricket, football, and badminton with friends, but chess holds a special place in my heart. My father introduced me to chess, and I vividly remember struggling with the piece movements at first. However, with practice, I eventually became proficient enough to beat him.

This competitive nature and love for problem-solving later extended into my programming endeavors. During my first term at the University of Waterloo, I created a chess game application using Angular in my spare time. The project not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also allowed me to refresh my frontend development knowledge.

Educational Background and Academic Achievements
I completed my schooling in my hometown, where my curiosity drove me to question concepts at a fundamental level. Initially, I found studying tedious due to the sheer volume of information to memorize. However, as I grasped the underlying principles, learning became enjoyable.

I completed my higher secondary education with distinction, ranking second among all CVM institutions and securing the highest marks in physics and mathematics. My fascination with computers began at an early age when my father bought a computer for our home. Though too young to understand its workings, I was always eager to explore and learn more. This curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.

Despite the disruptions caused by the global pandemic during my undergraduate years, I performed well, ranking among the top five students in my class. My primary goal was always to acquire new knowledge and apply it to solve real-world problems—an essential mindset for any engineer.

Initially, I was deeply interested in coding and actively participated in programming competitions, sometimes winning and sometimes narrowly missing victory. I competed in Google Code Jam 2021, successfully advancing to Round 2 but was unable to continue due to ongoing examinations.

Midway through my undergraduate studies, artificial intelligence and big data became industry-defining trends, sparking my curiosity. To deepen my understanding, I began watching YouTube tutorials and following industry leaders. I completed Stanford's renowned machine learning lecture series by Prof. Andrew Ng and later pursued deep learning studies through IIT Madras’ online courses.

This journey made me realize that machine learning is an intricate combination of linear algebra, multivariate calculus, probability, statistics, optimization, and creativity. Recognizing the importance of strong mathematical foundations, I dedicated significant time to solidifying these concepts.

To reinforce my learning, my friend and I decided to undertake a deep learning project in our third year—Image Colorization—which involved converting grayscale images into colored ones using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Back then, GANs were among the most advanced generative models, achieving impressive results. Our project successfully produced high-quality colorized images, validating our approach.

During my undergraduate years, I also worked on various other projects, including a simulation of the Enigma machine, a Wallbreaker game in C++, a WhatsApp clone for Android, and many more.

Internships and Industry Experience
I completed two internships during my undergraduate studies.

Nesco Ltd. – The company sought to automate its canteen management system. My team and I gathered stakeholder requirements, proposed solutions, and developed a minimum viable product (MVP) within a month. The client was satisfied and chose to extend the project further.

Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) – My second internship was at ISRO, where I worked on developing an intelligent system for monitoring Arctic sea ice. The project aimed to enhance remote sensing capabilities using machine learning models.

Conclusion
From childhood curiosity to academic excellence, a competitive spirit, and hands-on project development, my journey has been shaped by an eagerness to learn, a passion for problem-solving, and a drive to push boundaries. My experiences in AI, software development, and real-world applications through internships have prepared me well for tackling complex engineering challenges.
